### Summary
The Multireddit Digest App allows you to catch up on the most important things that happened on your favorite subreddits at a glance. I wanted an app like this to save time, so I could check Reddit just once a day and feel confident that I had seen the most important posts from all of my subs.

The user can paste a link to their multireddit rather than having to enter all of their favorite subs individually - this is the main feature I wanted that I couldn't find in similar apps. Additionally, the user can specify a maximum number of posts per sub and the time period (day, week, month, year, all time).

### Technologies Used
This front-end SPA was built using HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Redux, React Router, Flux, Webpack, and npm as a build tool.

### Future Versions

For future versions of this app, I would like to add a back end so that users can save their multireddit and preferences, and potentially a daily or weekly e-mail service.
